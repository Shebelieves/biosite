                    <p>On May 3, 1991, in Nassau, N.P, Bahamas, Dr. Chico J. Collie was welcomed by his mother, Beverly Musgrove. He grew up as an only child raised by his community consisting of his mother, grandparents, aunts, and church family. The love that was bestowed on him prepared him to love and take care of his family in a time when they were in need. While in high school Dr. Collie’s grandparents and aunt fell sick, he naturally and willingly fell into the role as co-caretaker seeking to understand their ailments to better serve them. When he was not busy completing assignments or studying for an upcoming test in high school you could find Dr. Collie by his Grandparents' and Great-Aunt's side feeding, nurturing, and making them as comfortable as possible.
                        <br />Caring for his family provided Dr. Collie a stepping stone into the medical field; consequently, after graduating high school Dr. Collie attended The College of the Bahamas from 2008-2012 to receive his Bachelor of Science degree in Biology with a minor in Chemistry. Next, he went onto The University of the West Indies (UWI)- Cave Hill campus, to receive his BMedSci (Dist.) and MBBS (Honors). During the transition through the various specialties the medical field has to offer, Dr. Collie was introduced to Pathology and discovered that his skills and passion were best suited and directed towards Anatomical Pathology.
                        <br />Dr. Collie enjoys the definitive nature of Pathology, as other medical professionals depend on a pathologist to make a final diagnosis which will guide the medical professional’s method of treatment for their patients. Pathology also provides Dr. Collie with an intellectual challenge because he must see all that there is to be seen; this includes analyzing the structural, bio-chemical, and functional changes in cells, tissues, and organs that can subsequently manifest diseases.
                        Upon completing his degree at UWI in 2017, he returned home to Nassau, Bahamas becoming a House Officer at Princess Margaret Hospital from June 2017-July 2018 then transitioned into a Senior House Officer in the Department of Pathology at Princess Margaret Hospital from July 2018 to July 2019. Starting in July of 2019, Dr. Collie took an opportunity to become a Resident in Jamaica at the University Hospital of the West Indies. He is currently serving as a Senior Resident at the hospital where he works with his fellow residents and students to progress his knowledge, skills, and experience in Pathology.
                        A typical day for Dr. Collie can be one of three things:
                                <ul>
                                <li><b>Trimming service-</b>Evaluating with the naked eye or macroscopically tissue and organs taken from patients.</li>
                                <li><b>Surgical service-</b>Reviewing slides in combination with clinical information to provide a diagnosis for physicians to disclose to their patients.</li>
                                <li><b>Autopsy service-</b>Performing autopsies on deceased persons to inform family or law enforcements of the cause of death.</li>
                                </ul>
                       <br />
                        Dr. Collie’s balanced consideration for the patients stands him out among his peers because he takes the time to acknowledge how his words, actions, and activities affect others. As a Pathologist, there is little to no direct interaction with the patients he is diagnosing; however, he incorporates the specimen or slide with the patient's clinical information in order to generate a full picture of the patient. This view allows him to appropriately diagnose the patient and lead Physicians onto the right course of action. Furthermore, he will go the extra mile to speak with patients and family members during difficult times, lending a form of comfort and reassurance of care.
                        <br />To balance the demands of Pathology, Dr. Collie loves spending time with his wife, Dr. Tareia Collie, reading books ranging from philosophy, biographies, literature, theology, and apologetics. For fun, Dr. Collie gathers with family and friends to participate in activities such as Sip n Paint, Uno, Taboo, watching T.V. shows and movies.<br /> You may overhear him engaging in meaningful conversations about worldviews or topics relating to the questions of existence and purpose. Dr. Collie is a devout Christian and expresses his thoughts and thorough studies of Christianity through his website <a href="https://www.maygp.org/" target="_blank"><b>May Grace Precede</b></a> and associated Podcast <a href="https://anchor.fm/maygraceprecede" target="_blank"><b>Walking Wisely and Worthily</b></a>. As a result of his website and Podcast, he aspires to help to create considerate, passionate, and intelligent Christian communities. He strives to see his local church family exemplify such a community. In addition, Dr. Collie looks forward to becoming an exceptional father to his future children, learning to speak different languages fluently, read and write great literature, set up a 'hobby' lab, study astronomy, be able to dance, hold a tune, and overall, gratefully enjoy his existence.
